> Address labels - how best to implement them?
    Step 0: do a tally of the tokens leading up to where the address label is
        1-byte:  halt, clrovr
        2-bytes: not, out, push, pop, ovrf, inc, dec, pb
        3-bytes: jmp, add, sub, movr, and, or, xor, readr, writr
        4-bytes: read, write, movl
        5-bytes: jeq, jgr
        other:   alloc
    Step 1: treat the address label as though #defined as the resultant count
